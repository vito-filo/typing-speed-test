# Typing Speed Test

A small typing game built with React + TypeScript + Vite.

Type through a passage and get your **WPM** and **accuracy**. Your best score is saved locally so you can try to beat it over time.

## Features

- **Two modes**
  - **Timed (60s):** type as much as you can before the timer expires.
  - **Passage:** finish the whole passage as fast/accurately as you can.
- **Difficulty selection:** Easy / Medium / Hard passages.
- **Live stats:** WPM, Accuracy, and Time.

## How to Play

1. Go to [Typing Speed Test](https://vito-filo.github.io/typing-speed-test/).
2. Choose a **Difficulty** and **Mode**.
3. Click the passage (or the Start button) and start typing.
4. Use the on-screen **Restart** button to reset the test.

Notes:

- The timer starts when you type your first character.
